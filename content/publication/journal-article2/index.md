abstract: In a hand–eye collaborative measurement system, the positioning error caused by pose change of an industrial robot end can make challenges during the high-precision measurement of large-scale components. Despite a robot own, the relative instability which causes error fluctuation is firstly proposed, and an end absolute pose tracking and compensation (EAPTC) method is developed. Firstly, using a watershed-model based on the Gaussian mixture model clustering, segmenting, and locking of the region of interest are achieved. The correction of ellipse distortion combined with camera internal parameters is employed, and the 3D coordinate is reconstructed. Subsequently, the common and link points are constructed to perceive the tracking of the targets. Based on the assumption of small-angle deviation, a novel model is established for compensating the relative instability. Ultimately, the experiment results indicate that the proposed method is effective for improving the measurement precision, which is superior to 0.075 mm.
