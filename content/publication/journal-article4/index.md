abstract: The accurate measurement of surfaces of large aviation components is vital for the assessment of manufacturing and assembly quality of such components. To satisfy the measurement requirement of large-size components, most current researches pay more attention to combined measurement methods utilizing different measuring instruments, but the related researches on error analysis and optimization methods are not taken enough attention. This paper proposes a combined laser-assisted measurement method with feature enhancement techniques, and it also develops an error propagation model of the main factors affecting the overall measurement error in detail. Firstly, the surface of a large-size component is measured by the measurement system at multiple stations. Secondly, a control point coordinate system is established as a bridge to unify all local measurement data into the global coordinate system. To improve the overall measurement accuracy, the pixel extraction error as a key factor causing the overall measurement error is analyzed in detail. Next, the error propagation model is established, and some optimization strategies of layout for minimizing measurement error and transformation error are researched. Finally, experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the measurement error of the proposed method reaches 0.073% and 0.14% with a 1D standard ruler and a flat plate, respectively.
